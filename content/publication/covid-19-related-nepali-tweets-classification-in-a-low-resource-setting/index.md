abstract: Billions of people across the globe have been using social media
  platforms in their local languages to voice their opinions about the various
  topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several organizations, including the
  World Health Organization, have developed automated social media analysis
  tools that classify COVID-19-related tweets to various topics. However, these
  tools that help combat the pandemic are limited to very few languages, making
  several countries unable to take their benefit. While multi-lingual or
  low-resource language-specific tools are being developed, there is still a
  need to expand their coverage, such as for the Nepali language. In this paper,
  we identify the eight most common COVID-19 discussion topics among the Twitter
  community using the Nepali language, set up an online platform to
  automatically gather Nepali tweets containing the COVID-19-related keywords,
  classify the tweets into the eight topics, and visualize the results across
  the period in a web-based dashboard. We compare the performance of two
  state-of-the-art multi-lingual language models for Nepali tweet
  classification, one generic (mBERT) and the other Nepali language
  family-specific model (MuRIL). Our results show that the modelsâ€™ relative
  performance depends on the data size, with MuRIL doing better for a larger
  dataset. The annotated data, models, and the web-based dashboard are
  open-sourced at https://github.com/naamiinepal/covid-tweet-classification.
