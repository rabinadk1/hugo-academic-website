abstract: The escalation in social media usage amid the pandemic has gathered
  extensive data for Natural Language Processing tasks, many of which solve some
  of the contemporary issues of the world. An abundance of these NLP tasks
  focuses on widely spoken languages like English. Moreover, researchers havenâ€™t
  exploited the true potential of NLP and the available data to extract a
  solution for prominent issues like the COVID-19 epidemic. We, through this
  project, present a COVID tweets analysis platform that allows health
  decision-makers to view a real-time analysis of narratives of tweets,
  particularly in Nepali and Devanagari scripts. Our method enables stakeholders
  to look into the public conversation and trends surrounding the COVID-19
  epidemic. We categorize the tweets across nine curated (mapped from WHO)
  topics using a MuRIL model to summarize our insights. Experimental results
  reveal the essence of our model as it can classify the tweets with appropriate
  scores for the evaluation metrics. The analysis of the results shows that our
  model can portray the growth in the discussions relating to different phases
  of the epidemic.
