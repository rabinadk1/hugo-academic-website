Hi, I am a computer engineering graduate from IOE, Pulchowk Campus, with a year of experience as a research assistant at NAAMII, a reputable research organization. My primary research interests lie in developing and applying machine learning techniques to solve practical problems, focusing on semi-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, and natural language processing.

At NAAMII, I gained valuable experience developing and implementing complex machine-learning models for various applications, including natural language processing and medical images. I have a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and mathematics, enabling me to create practical solutions to challenging problems. I am a self-motivated individual with strong self-management skills and comfortable working independently or as part of a team. I am passionate about producing high-quality results that have a real impact on society.

As I seek to further my knowledge and skills in machine learning, I am eager to pursue a Ph.D. program that would allow me to delve deeper into these research areas. With my research experience and passion for creating practical solutions, I am confident I can make meaningful contributions as a research assistant.
