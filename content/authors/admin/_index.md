Hi, I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Saarland University, Germany. I hold a degree in computer engineering from IOE, Pulchowk Campus, and have gained valuable experience as a research assistant at NAAMII, a leading research institute. My research interests lie in machine learning, focusing on semi-supervised learning, multimodal learning, and natural language processing.

At NAAMII, I developed and implemented advanced machine-learning models for real-world applications, including natural language processing and medical imaging. My strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and mathematics equips me to tackle complex challenges, and I am passionate about creating impactful solutions through technology.

I am eager to expand my machine learning and AI expertise through academic and research opportunities, with the long-term goal of pursuing a Ph.D. My research experience and passion for applying machine learning techniques to societal challenges enable me to contribute effectively to interdisciplinary research teams.
